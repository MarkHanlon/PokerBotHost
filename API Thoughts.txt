1) View all tables (or single table)

2) Register for seat at a table by adding yourself as a new player

POST /tables/{table_id}/player       (hierarchical)
POST /players?table_id={table_id}    (non-hierarchcal)

Body contains:
- Player name

Returns:
- Player token (used to make plays, must be kept secret for duration of game)
- Seat number

Errors:
- No seats available at table (Error 5??)

3) Look at my hole cards

GET /cards?player_id={player token}


*) Ideas for future:
- Add a grouping of tables (called tournaments) to allow more concurrent players in one large tournament
- Try to follow HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the engine of application state)
- Only the initial URL is known. Everything else can be changed and is linked in the response
